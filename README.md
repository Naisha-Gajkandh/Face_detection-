So this is an copy for face detection through python for attendence purpose. you can use it for other face reconization purpose also. 
you can chnage the names according to your choice in the apache folder you can see that how many python version/librery you need in your code editor befor running the code. so make sure you install all the librery first .you can see the image of the structure of the project in details folder .

****librery used  ********      
_OpenCV with contrib (for face detection/recognition)
OpenCV core (part of opencv-python packages)
NumPy (for image arrays)
Pillow (PIL) (for image processing)
pandas (for CSV data handling)
Kivy (for the GUI)_
**Detailed list of libraries and packages**
Core libraries
opencv-contrib-python
Reason: LBPH face recognizer (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())
opencv-python (usually included with the contrib package; if not, install separately)
numpy
Reason: image arrays and numerical operations
pillow (PIL)
Reason: image handling in training (e.g., Image usage)
Data handling
pandas
Reason: reading StudentDetails.csv, DataFrame operations
